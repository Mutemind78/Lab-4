            Today, most of the humans are victims of over-thinking, owing to that they are unable to find inner peace.
            Later over-thinking
            leads to depression, and sometimes individual feels over-depressed and commits sucide.

            However, to get rid of over-thinking, depression, anxity, etc. like problems people are suggested to
            meditation, which is quite
            difficult at it's initial stage but it's the only way to rid of such issues.
